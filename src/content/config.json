Thanks to the incredible work from Sunny, this advancement means that your favorite accessibility screen reader can now narrate scene elements and text to describe the scene to the user. It's our sincere hope that this addition will make it significantly easier for developers to create Babylon.js scenes that are more accessible for everyone and especially for visually impaired people across the web.",

We've listened closely to our community over the past year to restructure the organization of Babylon.js documentation with Babylon.js 6.0. This new organization restructures the same great information in a way that's more accessible to two core learning paths: those that want to first learn about Babylon.js and its feature set, and those that want to first understand how to integrate Babylon.js into their existing web applications. While there are many different types of learning objectives out there, these two paths represent the majority of new Babylon.js learners and this new documentation structure will better set them up for success as they begin their learning journey in the wonderful world of Babylon.js.
